## Notes

### src/_Examples 
This directory contains example code to be used as reference or to copy/paste into a /src/Sections file. Its purpose is to be used in the starter theme as filler content

### src/Sections 
This directory contains re-usable, pre-built sections that are commonly used across sites

### src/content 
This directory contains entire page content within the <main> tags so that pages can be duplicated. For example, a landing page for a particular service could be duplicated in a /services/example-service page. 

## Todos
